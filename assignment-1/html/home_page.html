                <p>The name’s Sam. I am a tireless seeker of knowledge,
                    occassional purveyor of wisdom and also, coincidentally,
                    a graphic designer.<br><br><b>PHILOSOPHY</b><br><br>
                    In as circuitous a reason as a philosopher is wont to offer,
                    my school of thought is reliant on schooling my thought – 
                    thoroughly, regularly; keeping abreast of design, branding,
                    advertising trends and solutions.</p>
